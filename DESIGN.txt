Project Statement:
We will be implementing an multi-player version of the Minesweeper game


How It Will Be Used:
-The game server will a two-player games to exist (was unable to get forking working)
-The game server will automatically pair any clients trying to connect to a game
-The game will use the standard rules of the single-player Minesweeper video-game
-Both players will share the same minesweeper board
-The two players will each go turn by turn, each player have to demine a block after each other with a time limit. Whoever first trigger the most mines will loose the game. 
-Both players are allowed to independently mark their own boards with flags at any time
-Optional Features: In-game chat, single-player variant


Technical Design:
*Memory allocation for the game
*Networking between the server + client computers to play the game
*Semaphores and shared memory to manage the gameboard.
*Signals to determine game states
*Inputs parsing to determine player commands

*Arrays for board storage
*Radomization to shuffle the boards and randomly distribute the mines
*Algorithm to ensure all blocks without nearby mine will be marked off after an selection with minimal computational effort. 


Predicted Timeline:
Server Communication Implementation
       -Completion on day 1~2
Client Game Structure + Player Interaction
       -Completion on day 7~8
Graphics + Multiple Game Instance
       -Completion on day 10~11	 	 
Optimization + Optional Features
       -Last two to three days
